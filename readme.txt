Display feeds of eBay Products from eBay Partner Network on your site.

== Description ==

WP eBay Product Feeds allows you to quickly and easily place feeds from the eBay Partner Network into your WordPress blog. These can easily be embedded into posts, placed as widgets or inserted into the themes - flexibility is huge. This plugin is ideal for bloggers who wish to make more money through their blogs by promoting eBay's affiliate programme, as well as users who sell their own items on eBay.

*Please Note* From 1st September 2020 the Dynamic Feed Generator from eBay is being withdrawn. We've tested another service - [RSS Ground](https://www.winwar.co.uk/?post_type=surl&p=4793&preview=true), that will be used to handle feeds, though any other feed generator will work.
