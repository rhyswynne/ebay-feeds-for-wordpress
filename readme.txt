== Description ==

eBay Feeds For WordPress allows you to quickly and easily place feeds from the eBay Partner Network into your WordPress blog. These can easily be embedded into posts, placed as widgets or inserted into the themes - flexibility is huge. This plugin is ideal for bloggers who wish to make more money through their blogs by promoting eBay's affiliate programme, as well as users who sell their own items on eBay.
